# Impact Assessment Tutorial

## Description

<p align="justify">The number of scientific publications has been increasing in recent decades and estimations are that this growth will continue. 
Until very recently most data on scientific publications was proprietary and hidden in data silos of majorcompanies. 
However, in recent years, a number of initiatives from the open science movement, such as Open Citations (<a href="https://opencitations.net/index/coci">COCI</a>), 
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a>, and the (recently discontinued) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/">
Microsoft Academic Graph</a> have led to vast amounts of such data being now publicly available. Hence, a variety of cross-domain scholarly knowledge graphs (SKGs),
both from the academic community, but also industry-driven ones, have been produced, striving to collect, clean, integrate, organise, and publish research objects and 
metadata. Such resources are catalysing the creation and provision of advanced exploration and knowledge extraction services for 
scholarly content, with the aim to boost research productivity, shorten the time from hypotheses to concrete results, and form the 
basis of a powerful toolbox for informed and fact-based decisions to support important workflows of researchers and other stakeholders 
(e.g., research policymakers).</p>

<p align="justify">The availability of the aforementioned data opens new possibilities for impact assessment of scientific publications. 
Assessing the impact of scientific publications is a task with a wide range potential applications. For example, it can help identify 
the most fruitful research areas and hence aid in research financing decisions. Further, hiring committees can take such measures into 
account as additional information in the assessment of applicants in academic and/or R\&D positions. Apart from such administrative 
uses, quantifying scientific paper impact also has a range of practical applications. For example, quantitative measures can be 
incorporated in academic search engines, facilitating publication search and reading prioritization by interested parties.</p>

## Impact Assessment in Scientific Knowledge Graphs

<p align="justify">Assessing the impact of scientific publications is not a straightforward task. First of all, a number of approaches 
to deal with this problem have ben proposed in the literature, without it being clear which approach is the most suitable and under
which conditions. Further, scientific impact should not be examined through a limited set of measures, since scienific impact
can be examined in many different ways. Hence, larger set of impact measures can capture a wider range of impact aspects, providing 
a more comprehensive picture about a publication's impact, as further evidenced by the <a href="https://sfdora.org/read">Declaration on 
Research Assessment</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">In this context, the main objective of the tutorial will be to inform and educate the audience about the opportunities and 
challenges that open Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) create in research impact assessment, presenting the respective state of the art and highlighting 
common pitfalls.</p>
